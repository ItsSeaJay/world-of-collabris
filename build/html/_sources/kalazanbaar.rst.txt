Kalazanbaar
===========
Durok founded the dwarven kingdom Kalazanbaar when he killed the Titan Raxis,
and split the mountain.

The Fall of Kalazanbaar
-----------------------
A civil war between the dwarves of Kalazanbaar and Korim. Korim, the smaller
kingdom to the north, developed the Construct technology they needed to beat the
larger, more established kingdom.

Even that was not enough. When the alliance of the Duegar and Drow emerged from
Below, the Dwarves of Kalazanbaar found themselves fighting a two front war,
and lost.

The dwarves of Korim are now reviled by many because winning their war had the
unintended side effect of annihilating their brothers to the south.
