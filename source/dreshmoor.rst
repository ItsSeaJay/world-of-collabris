The swamp ruled by Lizardman tribes, Goblins and goodness knows what else.
The lizardmen ambush human traders who trespass on their land for their metal.

They serve the Queen of Stone Magora, the medusa. She occupies the ruined city
of Coromagus.

.. NOTE: the wording of the original document here regarding the lizardmen was
         almost completely botched, hence the changes.
There are three main Lizardman tribes living here, all children of the dead
titan Raxis:
  * The red scale Xanthor tribe, led by Xartan
  * The black scale Oran tribe, led by Mallok
  * The green scaled Kuroth tribe, led by Hedora

Coromagus
---------
The ruined city of Coromagus, left over from the previous unknown civillisation.
Discovered and explored by the Elf Lady Maradel who sought its alien knowledge
and discovered something that cursed her, turning her into Magora, the medusa.
