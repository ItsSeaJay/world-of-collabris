################
The Dead Kingdom
################
Once a kingdom of men, formally known as the Southern Sanction, who were destroyed
by Kayleth-varr, the druid Archlich, who sold her soul to the god of death to
stop the Southern Sanction from cutting back the forest to make their
civilization.

Varr lives in a giant, petrified tree and makes the Stone giants of the island
her allies.

.. NOTE: Edited this section to sound more dramatic
The undead that haunt this corner of the world are the dead legions of the
Southern Sanction. Countless men and women who tried to carve civilization out of
the wilderness long ago.

This area, like the Northern Sanction, was ruled by three kings. Each of them,
including their generals became the Nameless. Eleven Wights who had their names
taken by the lich and ride nightmares.
