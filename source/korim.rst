The Crucible
============
The voting council of the three most powerful houses, thereby preventing ties in
the legislature.

  * **Great House Aurum**, ruled by Thane Ygnal the oldest house and first among
    equals on the Council of Brass. Voted against the alliance with Ardenia.

  * **Great House Cuprum**, ruled by Thane Gilmarad. Sided with House Argentum in
    the vote on an alliance with Ardenia.

  * **Great House Argentum**, ruled by Thane Helmoral, the youngest of the three
    great houses on the council, brokered the alliance with Ardenia. This peace
    has brought her house great wealth and power; this threatens Thane Ygnal and
    House Aurum.
