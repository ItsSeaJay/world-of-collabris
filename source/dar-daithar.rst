Dar-daïthar
===========
The underground empire of the Drow. Former allies of the Duegar, once the two
nations overthrew Kalazanbaar they instantly began fighting and now experience
a cold war of spies and assassins always on the brink of tipping over into open
conflict.

The men of the Northern Sanction consider this something devoutly to be avoided.
As soon as war breaks out between the Drow and the Duegar, the Maw will become
impassable. Once this happens, trade with the outside world via Titan's Gate
will end.

Within the vast expanse of Dar-daïthar are several kingdoms, ruled by the
Starless Court, and their Empress Veylastravix the Dark Star; the Fate Weaver.
Her device is a black star on a deep purple field.

The empress is an Oracle, subject to fits of prophetic ecstacy when the Goddess
of the drow has some important information to impart.
