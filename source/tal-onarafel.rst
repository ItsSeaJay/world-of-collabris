The haunted wood, formerly a nation of High Elves defeated by the Drow to the
South after their victory against Kalazanbaar. There are still High Elves here
but they wander the wood in mourning.

The Drow ransacked the High Elf capital of Vellardin. Killed the King and Queen
of the White Iris Court is in mourning, his wife and children slaughtered the
Drow. He is a paladin of the High Elf god Polaris. He refuses to take up the
mantle of nobility and the High Elves follow his lead. They call his noble
retinue the Court of the Fallen Leaves.

Most of the elves follow the lead of their Duke and want to fade away. But some
seek revenge against the Drow! They call themselves the Court of Winter and
follow Lady Verit, the Countess of Willow.
