The Veil
########
Inhabited by Wood Elves. They call the forest V’ael (Immortal Shroud), and
humans interpret that as “Veil.” Elves don’t know what this means. Humans are
happy calling it the Veil be cause the forest is constantly flooded with fog
from the nearby sea.

The Elves of V’ael are immortal as long as they stay in the forest’s mist.
Once they leave, they become mortal. A dying V’ael Elf who returns to the
forest, is restored to youth.

Under the veil lies a sleeping dragon. Basharix. It is the source of the fog.
The Elves of the Veil don’t know they’re protecting and ancient dragon.
They worship the forest.

Basharix
--------
The ancient dragon-titan, mate to the Titan Raxis. When Raxis was slain,
Basharix wept and went into her Long Slumber. Her tears create the fog.
The elves protect her. And await her awakening when she will revenge herself
upon the dwarves who slew her mate.
