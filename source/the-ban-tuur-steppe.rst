The Ban Tuur Steppe
###################
'Ban Tuur' means 'The Children of Tuur'. Animists who see gods in everything,
the greatest of which is the Volcano Tuur, the Father of Fire.

They are the horse lords of the south. Feirce nomadic warriors who raid their
neighbours and make life difficult for people trying to cross this region.

.. NOTE: Removed another expletive from this paragraph and replaced it with a
         dramatic-sounding sentance
The Ban Tuur believe Tuur's ash is holy and paint themselves with it before
combat. They call their elite cavalry 'The Ash Wind'. When you see these horse
riders covered in ash, you'd better have come prepared for the onslaught...

Their preists are the Firespeakers, who build ritual bonfires to commune with,
their god, and create the funeral pyres they use to dispose of their dead.

Led by their cheiftan, known as the GÃ¢n, a hereditary title crafted for the
first ruler of the horselands.

As a rite of passage for their adodolescents, they raid the road from Spineguard
Keep to Titan's Gate. The men of the Northern Sanction consider this an act of
war. Men are killed in these raids, after all. But the Ban Tuur refuse to be
negotiated with. Their response is always "children must learn to be adults.
What can be done?"

The Volcano
-----------
Known as Tuur to the nomads, they make no distinction between the volcano
itself, and the god it represents.

It is called the Basalt Throne by the Northern Sanction. It's lava is so
powerful, that it can be used to forge magic items. The men of the north want
it, but the steppe nomads protect and have no use for its magic forge.
