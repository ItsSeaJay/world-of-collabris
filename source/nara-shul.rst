Mountain home to the Nara, the griffon-riding Goliaths living in cities carved
into the rock. Skilled masons and stonecutters. Their capital city of Hethra
lies below the highest peak of the mountains, Kuraya. At the top of which lives
Uâ€™shaka, the God of the Goliaths, believed to be a Prince of the Air Elementals
and his servants, the Nine Winds, the Dukes of Sharash.

The first eight winds are:
  * Ahuema (brother)
  * Atuema (sister)
  * Herresh
  * Rosh, The Living Thunder
  * A'arifar
  * Merakish
  * Urraine
  * Bellathin
  * Shetheri the Frozen Bite
in addition to the wind that lifts from below (the spirit wind).

The griffon riders themselves are called the Mar-Ushaka, the Breath of God.
They are a religious caste among the Goliaths and serve ass messengers between
the mountainous cities.
