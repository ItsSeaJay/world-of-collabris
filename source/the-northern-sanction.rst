#####################
The Northern Sanction
#####################
Granted to the men of the north by the dwarves (back when they still ran this
place) it is the last remaining civilized area of Men, broken now into three
kingdoms:

Ardenia
=======
Allies of Korim. No peace yet with the neighbouring Orc tribes (maybe because
they're allies with the dwarves, who would cut off trade with Ardenia if they
made peace with the Orcs).

.. NOTE: There were a lot of mistakes here in the original document.
         Matt probably forgot that he gave the capital city of Ardenia a name,
         which has been assumed to be 'Arden' from the annotations on the final
         map of the Spinelands.

Ruled by Queen Aeleth, Ardenia is famous for its bardic college; the College of
the Whispered Song (A.K.A. the Whisper) lead by Master Troubadour Christoph.
Ardenia's bards travel the kingdoms from the high city of Arden all the way to
Titan's Gate, collecting and spreading news!

Suspected by the other nations, but never proven, rumor has it that Queen Aeleth
uses her bardic college as a spy network, keeping the larger, more prosperous
Kingdoms of Haldrim and Cardus at bay.

Haldrim
=======
.. NOTE: The original document uses 'PCs' to refer to 'Player Characters' instead
         of people.
Probably where most people start their adventures. Lots of Half-Orcs in this
area, because of the close proximity to the Urshok Hills and Red Sun Orc tribe.

.. NOTE: Decided to remove the expletive from this paragraph. This might be
         changed in the future. In addition, it's very unclear what 'Sethis' is
         in the original document. Here, it's been assumed that it's the name
         of a captain-turned-rogue from how it's referred to in a later sentance.
Haldrim made a truce with the Orcs to the north, aggrivating Sethis (their
legion captain) whose men took to the hills and became the first bandits. They
were soon joined by others. Sethis is now Lord of the Bandit Tribes.

You often just get straight up Orcs hanging out here who are outcasts from the
Red Sun tribe.

Haldrim is ruled by King Cyric the Grey, in his 91st year. He remembers the
kingdom of Kalazanbaar and yearns for those older days when the dwarves of the
Broken Spine endured peace throughout the land.

Certainly closer to his end than his beginning, Cyric fears what will happen
when he passes. His daughter will be Queen, and Princess Elise lost her husband
to the Orc Warfather (then a young Headtaker) Valkun. Cyric knows if his eldest
daughter becomes Queen, the peace with the Orcs will quickly convert to war.
A vocal, traditional minority would like this very much and in spite of her
hawkish sensibilities, the majority of the people of Haldrim love Princess Elise
and remember her as a girl.

His younger daughter, Miranda, is a potent enchanter and while Cyric would rather
hand the reins of the country to her, whom he trusts, the people are deeply
suspicious of sorcery and would not follow a Wizard-Queen ruling from her
Tower of Sorcery.

Preparing for the inevitable succession war, Princess Miranda has already forged
a secret alliance with Master Troubadour Christoph, who promised to help
overthrow (or even assassinate) Princess Elise before she can ascend to the
throne.

Cardus
======
Cardus has the largest standing army in the Northern Sanction, but they use it
for defense. They can't commit troops to the pass as they're busy holding their
ground against the Men of the Scale Hills.

Ruled by King Godfrey, the teenaged ruler only recently came to the throne when
his father king Edmond died in battle against the Snake Men (Yuan-ti) of the
Scale Hills. Rumers persist that King Edmond's death was not the glorious last
stand that the bards sing of... The absense of a body to recover mean the rumors
never die.

Godfrey was raised to be a king and a knight, and at fifteen is already a capable
horseman and warrior.

Eager to avenge his father, he is advised by the Knight-commander Duncan.

Unbeknownst to the people, the bards and even the young king, Edmond is not
dead. He fell in battle, his retinue slain (meaning that there were no witnesses
to the event) he was kidnapped by the Yuan-ti, who intended to ransom him back
to Duncan.

But Duncan is happy with Godfrey on the thron, because the young king is in
favor of an aggressive campaign over the mountains, into the Scale Hills; to
wipe out the hereditary threat of the Snake Men once and for all.

King Edmond was a realist and a pragmatist, always willing to negotiate with the
opposing side. Duncan did not approve of this and raised Godfrey to be the king
he wished Edmond would be.
