Urshok
######
Home to the Red Sun tribe of Orcs.

Once, Urshok stretched south into the mountains, including the Burnt Hills,
but the men of the Northern Sanction cut back the forest and drove the Orcs
north. Because of this, they now refer to themselves as the Kanrokk - literally
'The Homeless'.

.. NOTE: Matt appears to confuse Haldrim and Ardenia here. Why does Haldrim
         depend on trade with Korim when Ardenia is objectively closer?
         In any case, Haldrim has been assumed based on the information given
         about the Northern Sanction throughout the rest of the document.
         Oh, and there was an unintentional rhyme that has been fixed.
They also have a blood feud with the men of the Northern Sanction, which was
quenched just recently when Haldrim made peace. But only so much peace can be
made without alienating the dwarves of Korim, who they depend on for supplies.

The Red Sun Tribe
=================

.. NOTE: Warfather Valkun's entry just kind of stops here, so something has been
         made up to fill in the gap.
Warfather Valkun
----------------
Negotiated peace with Haldrim in exchange for access to the port city of Titan's
Gate. He wants to trade with the other regions of Collabris. With access to the
trade routes that intersect with Titan's gate, he might just be able to achieve
that level of influence.

Warmaster Valarak
-----------------
Sister to the Warfather and leader of the Warhounds; the army of Orcs who charge
into battle with their dire boars. Should Valkun die, Valarak will likely
replace him as the Warmother.

Beastmaster
------------
Title given to the kennel master of the dire boars that accompany the
Warhounds into battle.

Headtakers
----------
The elite commandos of the Warfather. They are assassins who garrotes, and
literally take the heads of their victims.

Sunbreaker
----------
Amarax the Shaman. Who begins his rituals at dusk when the sun falls.
