## Description
Collabris is a mid-fantasy campaign setting for the fifth edition of the
Dungeons and Dragons role playing game. Named because of the word's similarity
to `collaboration` (reference to how the setting was created) and `colville`
(surname of the original author), Collabris is a world fit for all kinds of
adventurers, even those from
[the Elemental Evil Player's Companion](http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/EE_PlayersCompanion.pdf).

This project is an attempt to convert that setting from a rock-solid PDF to
a set of Restructured Text files that tech-savvy Dungeon Masters can more easily
expand on and customise. In addition to people being able to have it as a PDF.

## History
(Most of which has been summarised from
[this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/4mjk4f/collabris_the_story_so_far_a_world_we_built/))

In 2016, independent fantasy author Matt Colville wanted to show prospective
Dungeon Masters the benefits of building their own world for the game;
how enjoyable it could be and how everyone had the ability to do it.
Using [Hexographer](http://hexographer.com/), he generated a random map and filled
it to the brim with details. All of which was streamed live and most of the
names, places and people were suggested by the viewing audience.

After he'd finished, he released it out into the wild for anyone to use. It was
a huge success. People drew their own versions of the map, created characters
for it and one person
[even created authentic heraldry for all of the known factions](http://www.danconnolly.co.uk/2016/05/to-arms/).

In 2018, after a successful D&D campaign set in Collabris, some jerk named Callum
expressed interest in making Collabris more malliable.
[After a moderately successful post on the `/r/mattcolville` subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mattcolville/comments/8ahdol/open_sourcing_collabris/)
asking for permission to create a GitHub repo based on the world, he decided to
put his money where his mouth is and go for it...
